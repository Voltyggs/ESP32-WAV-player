# ESP32-WAV-plyer
oooooookkkkkkkkkaaaaayyyyyyyy so this is my biggest project yet. It's a 8 bit 44.1KHz mono .WAV audio player. it uses an esp32. IT even has some pretty cool features like save the track, its postiton, and the volume, and it even has double buffers!<br/>
<br/>
to use this, first, solder the speaker and the uSD card reader to their appropriate pins. then, format an uSD card to FAT32. After, use audacity or any software capabale, to format an audio file into unsigned 8 bit 44.1KHZ audio. then it's just plug and play. use the appropriate buttons to navigate the tack.<br/>
<br/>
There are some special features of this audio players like a settings.txt. it holds the track, the track position, and the volume. It loads itself during bootup, and can be updated by holding down the press/pause buttton. <br/>
here are some cool screenshots: <br/>
